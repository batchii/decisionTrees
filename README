1. Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This README is part of a scaffold provided for students taking JHU's Artificial
Intelligence class.  It is intended to give students an idea of the directory
structure they are expected to use when submitting assignments for this class.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All code resides in the src/ subdirectory, which also contains a Makefile that
can build and run the code.  As a convenience, the top level directory also
contains shellscripts which call `make`.  The run.sh script also passes any
command line arguments given to it along to the Java program, in case you want
your Java program to make use of command line arguments.

You are not required to use Make for your homework; so long as your shell
scripts do what they're supposed to, you can write them any way you like (see
assignment PDF for details).





To build the program, cd to the src/ subdirectory, and do `make`; to run the
program, do `make run`; and to build the JavaDocs, do `make docs`.  The binary
class files will be put in the bin/ subdirectory, and the html document files
will be put in the doc/ subdirectory.


Additional Information:

3. Please enter any columns to ignore (keep typing until you don't have
anymore or -1 to signal finished)
